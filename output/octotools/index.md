# Tutorial: octotools

`octotools` is a versatile framework designed to understand and solve user queries, including those with **images**.
It intelligently plans a series of steps, selects appropriate *Tools* from a modular architecture, and uses integrated Large Language Models (**LLMs**) to execute tasks like generating code or analyzing visuals.
The system maintains a *Memory* of its actions and verifies context before providing a final answer. It also includes a system to *evaluate* its performance on various benchmarks.
